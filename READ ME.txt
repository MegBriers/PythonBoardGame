hello and welcome to the pendrive storing all of megan's computing project (don't worry I've backed it up)

a guide to finding your way around:
- looking for the writeup/all the documents?
 	Check the 'Advanced Higher Computing Project.doc' for a version of the writeup
	with additional comments to show the iterations the documents went through!

- looking for the best part of the project, aka the record of progress
	Look for the internet shortcut, it will take you to the blog I have been keeping. 
	You must have glow to access it and you also must be a permitted user to read it,
	any difficulties/questions please just ask. 

- looking for a good time?
	you've come to the wrong place! JOKING, try playing the pirate game, it requires
	three players, and you have to have Python and PyGame installed on your computer,
	please also see the User Guide at the back of the documents for more details!

- a little warning about input validation
	as daniel and lewis were quick to point out, my input validation is a little bit
	'fragile' shall we say? it doesn't really like anything that isn't a number, it is
	fine for validation between ranges but try not to enter an un-necessary space bar etc
	. If the game does crash, like stated in the User Guide, you will have to restart everthing	
	very sorry.

Enjoy marking !!!

ps. I don't have a very good history with usb sticks, please try not to lose or corrupt, cause 
honestly im running out of sticks that I haven't broken or lost.

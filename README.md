# PythonBoardGame
The pirate game is a quick game that starts by requiring the player to place different tiles in a 7 by 7 grid. The game will randomly generate a grid co-ordinate after each player has filled up their grid and the action of the player each round will be dependent on what is placed in the square. It is a multiplayer game which will have to be played over a network as it requires three players. The interfaces will change throughout to allow users to make choices based on their tiles. 

It was implemented for my Advanced Higher Computing project, and met the criteria of using 2D arrays to store grid co-ordinates, using a sorting algorithm, both to generate random co-ordinates throughout the game and to assess who has won the game. 

For a full overview of the project, please read the 'Advanced Higher Computing Project' pdf, for evidence of design considerations, progress, testing and evaluation.
